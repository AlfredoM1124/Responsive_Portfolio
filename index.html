			<h3>About Me</h3>
				<img id="headshot" src="assets/images/MyBestPic.jpg" alt="Photo of me">
				<p class="bodyText">
				I am a Full-Stack Web Developer in training, currently enrolled at the University of Central Florida's Boot Camp. I am well-versed in Front End technologies such as HTML, CSS, and a number of Frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize. I also have a good understanding of Back-End technologies like Javascript, JQuery, and NodeJS. I have some experience working with databases using MySQL, and am currently working diligently to learn as many new coding languages as I can.
				</p>
					<br>
				<p class="bodyText">
				I was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, and grew up learning both Spanish and English. Ever since I was young I have had an affinity for technology and I've been around computers, televisions, and video games ever since I can remember. My passion is to keep learning and progressing in as many tech related fields as I can, because I feel the world is shifting towards a digital market, and I would like to take advantage of the changing culture.
